**Compilation Instructions**

This android application was built using Android Studio and the Gradle build; it cannot be run from within Eclipse. Dependencies are all managed by Gradle, handled from the build.gradle files, and so should take no additional configuration. It also uses the most recent APIs from Google for the Material Design theme, so you must make sure you have downloaded the following packages from the SDK Manager, or else it will not compile:

-21.0.2 Built Tools

-All Android 5.0 (API 21) packages

-Android Support Library

-Android Support Repository

To compile and install the application, simply open the project from within Android Studio and hit 'run'. Gradle will build the app and install it on your physical or virtual device. If it will not compile, you must make sure you have all the necessary packages downloaded from the SDK Manager; this app has no external dependencies outside of the Android SDK packages.
